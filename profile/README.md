# COMBINA

**Coastal Ocean Marine Biosecurity International Network of the Americas**

**Our goal:** Preventing or reducing the number of new marine bioinvasions and reducing bioinvasion impact at local, national, and continental scales by accelerating knowledge exchange and capacity building. **Our approach:** Working as an international network to advance and support coordinated marine biosecurity across the Americas.

  - Training workshops
  - Student exchanges and internships

- Seeks to mobilize shared methods, tools, and [resources](https://marinebiosecurity.org/resources) across countries by compiling existing resources and working together to build new tools:

  - Standardized protocols for invasion detection
  - Non-native species databases and information resources
  - Invasion alert system and risk prediction
  - Community engagement and outreach

- Provides a [platform](https://marinebiosecurity.org/people) for coordinated research and action to:

  - Advance scientific understanding of marine invasion dynamics across spatial and temporal scales
  - Inform management and policy decisions for effective biosecurity

## Our history

The concept for COMBINA grew from an [initial workshop](https://marinebiosecurity.org/assets/pdf/Informe-Final_Galapagos-2019-Invasions-Workshop.pdf) held in the Galápagos Islands in June 2019 with participants across 10 countries in the Americas, including scientists, policy-makers, and resource managers. The workshop underscored strong demand and need for coordination, shared resources, information exchange, and training across countries. The COMBINA network was announced at the [2023 Our Ocean Conference](http://ouroceanpanama2023.gob.pa/) in Panamá and formally launched at a [second workshop](https://stri.si.edu/story/combina), held in Panamá in March 2024 with over 70 participants from 12 different countries.
