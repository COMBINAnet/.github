**Coastal Ocean Marine Biosecurity International Network of the Americas**

| Our goal | Our approach |
|-|-|
|Preventing marine bioinvasions and their impacts — at local, national, and continental scales. | Working as an international network to advance and support coordinated marine biosecurity across the Americas. |

Our network aims to:

#### Accelerate knowledge exchange and capacity building through:

- Annual regional meeting
- Training workshops
- Student exchanges and internships

#### Mobilize shared methods, tools, and resources across countries for:

- Standardized protocols for invasion detection
- Non-native species databases and information resources
- Invasion alert system and risk prediction
- Community engagement and outreach

#### Create a platform for coordinated research and action to:

- Advance scientific understanding of marine invasion dynamics across scales
- Inform management and policy decisions for effective biosecurity

## Our history

The concept for COMBINA grew from an initial workshop held in the Galápagos Islands in June 2019 with participants across 10 countries in the Americas, including scientists, policy-makers, and resource managers. The workshop underscored strong demand and need for coordination, shared resources, information exchange, and training across countries. The COMBINA network was announced at the [2023 Our Ocean Conference](http://ouroceanpanama2023.gob.pa/) in Panamá and formally launched at a [second workshop](https://stri.si.edu/story/combina), held in Panamá in March 2024 with over 70 participants from 12 different countries.
